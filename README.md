# house-price-prediction-ml
I built a web-based machine learning app using Streamlit that predicts house prices based on user inputs like bedrooms, area size, and year built. The model was trained on real housing data, cleaned and processed in Python, and then deployed as an interactive app. Users can enter details of a house and instantly see the estimated price. This project shows my skills in data preprocessing, model building, and deploying ML models to a user-friendly web interface.
